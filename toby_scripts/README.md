# 🐶 Toby Chat Scripts

This folder contains **standalone Python scripts** related to Toby the Story Dog — for development, AI experiments, and fun extras that aren’t part of the deployed website.

These scripts are **not included in the Next.js build or Vercel deployment**.  
They’re stored here for convenience so all Toby-related code lives in one project.

## 📁 Folder Contents

- **toby_chat.py** — main Toby chat logic (used for generating playful responses, testing AI, etc.)
- *(optional)* `helpers/` — for additional Python modules or data files
- *(optional)* `.gitignore` — to ignore logs or cache files
